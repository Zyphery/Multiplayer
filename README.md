# Multiplayer

A demo project

This demo is to test multiplayer features, to set and use as an example for future projects.
Hopefully to set a standard for networking code and make it easier to develop a multiplayer game.

I made this to learn how multiplayer is done, especially in the newer versions of Godot, as I
could not find many tutorials and the documentation was sparse.

All the code is done in gdscript, a programming language developed by Godot for Godot.

Developed in the Godot Engine v4.0.3
